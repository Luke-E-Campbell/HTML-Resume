<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>
  Hello! I'm Luke Campbell and I love programming.</h2>


<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>
  Throughout the years I've gained a passion for coding through different courses and various <br>
  projects. What drove me to becoming a full stack developer was the job growth potential and <br>
  the ability to work with teams in order to create fully functional websites, applications, and <br>
  tools for businesses and clients. To be able to code and creatively solve challenges/problems <br>
  is my kind of dream.
</p>

<h3>Education:</h3>
<p>
  I graduated from Howard Community College in 2019 with an associates degree in <br>
  Cybersecurity. During that time I had the pleasure of working hands on with cisco routers, <br>
  switches and firewalls, learning the fundamentals of network security, setting up networks, <br>
  learning encryption standards, ethical hacking, and Linux system administration. I then graduated <br>
  from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2022 with a bachelor's degree in <br>
  Information Systems. There I gained my passion for full stack development taking courses such <br>
  as UX/UI Design, Java Programming I, Java Programming II, Gui Systems Using Java, Database <br>
  Application Development and Structured System Analysis/Design.
</p>

<h3>Skills and Expertise:</h3>
<p>
  Since October of 2023 I've been spending my time learning the ins and outs of web development, <br>
  as well as backend development. I started with learning html one week, css another, then <br>
  JavaScript, Bootstrap Framework, jQuery library, Node JS runtime environment, Express JS <br>
  framework, and I am still in the process of learning more like EJS, PostgreSQL, Python, Java, <br>
  and React JS.
</p>


<h3>Projects:</h3>
<h4>HTML Portfolio Website:</h4>
<p>While learning HTML I created an html only resume portfolio using VSCode. Creating <br>
  this resume taught me the basics of html such as the different tags, how to add photos, and <br>
  anchors for an "about me" and "contact me" page.</p>

<h4>TinDog Website:</h4>

<p>While learning CSS, Bootstrap, Flexbox, Grid, I created a dating website for dogs in using <br>
  VSCode. The Website taught me how to use Bootstrap for various sections such as the <br>
  features, the testimonal, the pricing, and the footer. In addition I used media queries to make <br>
  the website responsive regardless of screen size.

<h4>Dice Game Challenge:</h4>
<p>While learning about JavaScript and the Docuement Object Model (DOM), I created a dice <br>
  game using VSCode where you and a second player go against eachother to see who <br> 
  has the highest number. If you win the game the game displays that the player has won but if <br>
  the player loses then a player lost message is displayed. If the game is a tie then a tie message <br>
  is displayed.

<h4>Drum Kit Project:</h4>
<p>While learning about advanced JavaScript and the Docuement Object Model (DOM), I created <br>
  a drum kit using VSCode where based on which image you click it will produce the <br> 
  sound of that image. In addition I also added the function to used the W, A, S, D, J, K, L keys <br>
  that will also play the sound of the image based on which key it is matched up with.

<h4>Simon Says Game Challenge:</h4>
<p>
  While learning about jQuery, I created a Simon Says game that keeps track of the games <br>
  pattern and the players pattern. The player can press any key to start and everytime the player <br>
  gets the right pattern then they go up one level. If the player gets the wrong pattern when <br>
  matched to the games pattern then the game ends and the player has the option of starting over.
